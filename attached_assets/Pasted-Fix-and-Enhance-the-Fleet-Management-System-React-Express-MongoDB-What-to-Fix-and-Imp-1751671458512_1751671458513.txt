Fix and Enhance the Fleet Management System (React + Express + MongoDB)

---

🔧 What to Fix and Improve:

### ✅ 1. Add Delete Trip Log Feature
- Add a DELETE endpoint:
```ts
DELETE /api/trips/:tripId
Backend: find the trip by ID and delete it from the database
Frontend: In “Recent Trip Logs” UI, add a small Trash/Delete button per entry
On confirmation, remove it from both DB and UI state
✅ 2. Driver-wise Recent Trip Status (Low/Good/Excellent)
In Driver Summary section, display:
Low: if tripCount < 10
Good: if tripCount == 10
Excellent: if tripCount > 10
Add colored badge or emoji (🔴 🟡 🟢) to show visually
Example:
function getTripStatusLabel(count) {
  if (count < 10) return "Low";
  if (count === 10) return "Good";
  return "Excellent";
}
✅ 3. Optimization Tip (Slab-Based Dynamic Target Helper)
Show company-specific slab progress tips in dashboard per vehicle:
For Letzryd:
const letzrydSlabs = [
  { trips: 140, rate: 260 },
  { trips: 125, rate: 380 },
  { trips: 110, rate: 470 },
  { trips: 80, rate: 600 },
  { trips: 65, rate: 710 },
  { trips: 0, rate: 950 },
];
For PMV:
const pmvSlabs = [
  { trips: 140, rate: 150 },
  { trips: 135, rate: 249 },
  { trips: 120, rate: 444 },
  { trips: 80, rate: 640 },
  { trips: 65, rate: 750 },
  { trips: 0, rate: 949 },
];
Logic:
Based on totalTrips and vehicle company, find current slab
Then calculate how many more trips needed to reach the next better slab
Display like this:
Optimization Tip: 15 more trips needed to reach ₹600/day slab. Current: 65 trips, Target: 80 trips.
Function example:
function getOptimizationTip(company, currentTrips) {
  const slabs = company === 'Letzryd' ? letzrydSlabs : pmvSlabs;
  const nextSlab = slabs.find(slab => slab.trips > currentTrips);
  if (!nextSlab) return "You've reached the best slab!";
  return `${nextSlab.trips - currentTrips} more trips needed to reach ₹${nextSlab.rate}/day slab. Current: ${currentTrips} trips, Target: ${nextSlab.trips} trips.`;
}
✅ Required Backend Updates:
DELETE /api/trips/:tripId → Delete trip log
GET /api/vehicle/:id/trips/total → Get current weekly total
Use aggregation if needed to sum weekly trip counts
✅ Required Frontend Updates:
Add Delete button in Recent Trip Log table with confirmation popup
Add badge in Driver Cards for “Low”, “Good”, “Excellent” status
Add Optimization Tip under each vehicle card
Update tip dynamically as trip count increases weekly
✅ Optional UI Enhancements:
Use colors or emojis:
🔴 Low
🟡 Good
🟢 Excellent
Optimization Tip can auto-refresh or be shown as a small helper tooltip next to rental info
🎯 Final Outcome:
Admin can delete bad trip entries
System shows trip performance quality per driver
Dashboard gives clear insight into how to level up slab with remaining trips
Better decision-making for pushing drivers to hit rent-saving targets
